# Reddit User Persona Generator (BeyondChats Internship Task)

This project is a Python script that takes a **Reddit user profile URL**, scrapes their latest posts and comments using Reddit‚Äôs API, and uses an **open-source LLM via Ollama** to generate a **detailed user persona** in `.txt` format.

The generated persona includes:
- User details (age, occupation, location, etc.)
- Behavior and habits
- Frustrations and motivations
- Personality type (introvert/extrovert, intuitive, etc.)
- Goals and needs
- **Quoted evidence** from Reddit content for each point
